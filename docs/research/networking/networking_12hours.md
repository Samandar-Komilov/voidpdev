# Computer Networking in 12 hours course notes


### Section 1: TCP/IP and OSI models


### Section 2: Bits and Bytes


### Section 3: Ethernet (Physical & Data Link Layer)

1. There are 3 major forms that is used to transmit data over a computer network in Physical layer:
- Copper cables: the cheapest, but the speed is very limited and the wire length is max 100m.
- Fiber optics: expensive, high speed, wire max length 200km
- Wireless (signals): low-cost, depends on router, ~50-100m range

2. Network Interface Card makes it happen to use networks to the devices. Wired and wireless NICs exist. Actually, when our new ASUS Vivobook couldn't work with Linux, the Network Card inside didn't have the drivers and thus we changed it.

3. MAC Address - unique hardware address for every device in the world. Devices must have different MAC addresses to be able to communicate with each other in a single network. Each Ethernet Network Interface Card must have UNIQUE MAC address, otherwise you can't communicate in network.
Each manufacturer got its own ranges of MAC addresses.

MAC address is 6 octet (48 bits) number. First 3 octets are for Organizational ID, Last 3 octets are for NICs specifics.

Available MAC address count: 2^48 = over 280 trillion
