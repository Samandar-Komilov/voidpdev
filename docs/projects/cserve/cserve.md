CServe is a web server written in C. Inspired from nginx, and started with a huge motivation to learn network programming and system-level thinking. The project is divided into chapters, each of which focuses on a specific feature or technique. The chapters are ordered by difficulty level, starting with the basics and gradually increasing in complexity.  

!!! note
    This document shows the 1st phase of the project implementation (April 13 - June 8). The 0.2.0 version is in progress...

The overall plan was as follows:  


### 0️⃣ Basic TCP Server
**Goal**  
Create a foundation that listens for and accepts TCP connections, setting up the socket infrastructure for later HTTP functionality. 

**Implementation**  
Use a `Server` struct to store socket configuration. Implement `server_constructor` to initialize the struct, create a socket with `socket()`, bind it to a port using `bind()` and start listening with `listen()`. Don't forget to set the `S0_REUSEADDR` option to avoid "address already in use" errors.
Create a `launch()` function that runs an infinite loop, calling `accept()` to handle incoming connections and logging each connection.


### 1️⃣ Basic HTTP Server
**Goal**  
Extend the TCP server to parse HTTP requests and respond with a static HTTP response, introducing HTTP protocol handling.

**Implementation**  
Define an `HTTPRequest` struct to store parsed request data:
- `method`, `path` and `version`
- `Headers`
- `header_count`
- `Body`
- `body_length`

Implement `http_request_parser` to read the request from a client socket, tokenize the request line, and parse headers until an empty line (`\r\n`).
Create an `HTTPResponse` struct for responses.

**Best Practices**  
- Allocate memory dynamically for `HTTPRequest` fields and free them with `http_request_free` to prevent leaks. 
- Test with curl http://localhost:8080 to verify the response. 
- Use Valgrind to check for memory leaks in `http_request_parse`.


### 2️⃣ Static File Serving
**Goal**  
Serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, images) from a directory, adding a key Nginx feature.

**Implementation**  
Introduce an `HTTPServer` struct to manage HTTP-specific state: a reference to the `Server` struct, a `static_dir` path, and a `handler` function pointer for processing requests. The constructor should also initialize `static_dir`.

**Best Practices**  
- Allocate a buffer for file contents dynamically based on file size.
- Test with a browser to verify files (e.g., index.html, images) are served correctly.
- Log file access errors (e.g., “File not found”) to debug issues.
- Hardcode common `Content-Type` values (e.g., `text/html` for .html, `image/png` for .png) in a lookup table, deferring MIME type detection libraries.
- Check for path traversal attacks (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) by validating the resolved path stays within `static_dir`.

### 3️⃣ Reverse Proxy
**Goal**  
Forward HTTP requests to a backend server, let's say FastAPI app on Uvicorn, enabling the server to act as a reverse proxy. Relay the backend’s response back to the client.

**Implementation**  
Extend `HTTPServer` to include a `proxy_backends` array, which includes strings like `“localhost:8000”` and `backend_count`. Implement `proxy_request` to:
- Create a new socket to connect to the backend using `socket()` and `connect()`.
- Reconstruct the client’s HTTP request (method, path, headers) and send it to the backend.
- Read the backend’s response and forward it to the client.

Update the handler function in `HTTPServer` to decide whether to serve a static file or proxy based on the request path (e.g., proxy `/api/*` to the backend, serve `/static/*` from disk).

**Best Practices**  
- Handle connection failures (e.g., backend down) by returning a `502 Bad Gateway` response.
- Test with a Python FastAPI app running on `localhost:8000` and `curl` to verify proxying.
- Use `strace` to debug socket issues between the server and backend.

### 4️⃣ Load Balancing
**Goal**  
Distribute requests across multiple backends to improve scalability, adding load balancing to the reverse proxy. Support multiple backend servers (e.g., `localhost:8000`, `localhost:8001`). Implement a **round-robin algorithm** to distribute requests evenly.

**Implementation**  
Define a `Backend` struct with host (e.g., `“localhost”`) and port (e.g., `8000`). Store backends in `HTTPServer`’s `proxy_backends` as an array of strings, parsed into `Backend` structs at runtime. Implement `choose_backend` to select the next backend in a round-robin fashion, tracking the current index with a static variable. Modify `proxy_request` to use the selected backend’s host and port. Update `handler` to call `choose_backend` for proxied requests.

**Best Practices**  
- Log which backend handles each request to verify distribution.
- Test with multiple FastAPI instances (e.g., on ports `8000` and `8001`) and `wrk` to simulate load.
- Assume backends are always available, adding health checks in a future iteration if needed.


### 5️⃣ Config File (.ini)
**Goal**  
Add a configuration file to make the server flexible, allowing users to specify the port, static directory, and backends without recompiling. Parse a simple `.ini` configuration file to set server parameters. Use the parsed values to initialize the `Server` and `HTTPServer` structs.

**Implementation**  
Define a config file format like:
```ini
port=8080
static_dir=./static
backend=localhost:8000
backend=localhost:8001
```
Implement `parse_config` to read the file line by line, extracting key-value pairs (e.g., `port`, `static_dir`, `backend`). Then store parsed backends in a dynamic array for `HTTPServer`. Update `main` to call `parse_config` and pass the results to `server_constructor` and `http_server_constructor`.

**Best Practices**  
- Validate config values (e.g., port range, valid directory) to prevent crashes.
- Provide default values (e.g., port `8080`) if the config file is missing.
- Test with different config files to ensure flexibility.


### 6️⃣ Concurrency (Event-based)
**Goal**  
Enable the server to handle multiple clients concurrently using an event-based model, improving performance and scalability.
- Replace the single-threaded `accept()` loop with an event-driven model to handle multiple connections simultaneously. That way, process client requests (parsing, static files, proxying) without blocking other clients.

**Implementation**  
Use `select()` (then `epoll()` later on) to monitor multiple sockets for events.
Modify `launch()` to:
- Initialize a `fd_set` for `select`.
- Accept new connections and add client sockets to the set.
- Read and process requests from ready sockets, calling handler for HTTP logic.
- Close sockets after processing to free resources.

Maintain a dynamic array or list of active client sockets in HTTPServer to track state.

**Best Practices**  
- Limit the number of concurrent connections (e.g., `1024`) to avoid `select`’s file descriptor limit.
- Test with `wrk` to measure throughput under load (e.g., 100 concurrent clients).
- Use `Valgrind` to ensure no memory leaks in the event loop.
- Stick to a single thread to avoid threading complexity, mimicking Nginx’s event-driven model.
